# JavaScript Manifesto

I am constantly writing, and often rewriting, various code conventions, style guides, philosophical musings, tips, tricks, and whatever else as part of my role at the company I work for.  I often title using terms that imply that the style is *of the company*, such as the **"Official Company Style Guide"**.

However, I am only able to dictate the "company style" because I am the lead developer.  The style is, in fact, *my* style.. and if I am replaced by some other developer, he or she will no doubt introduce changes to the style guide to better suit his or her own style.

So, I've decided to change strategy a bit and create a book containing every aspect of my style in JavaScript software development.

That book will be placed here, as I am able to find the time.
